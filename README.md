## About <a name = "about"></a>

React Layman is a fully-featured, dynamic layout manager made for React. It is written in Typescript and provides typing, but may also be used with regular Javascript. Layman is inspired by [Replit](https://replit.com)'s IDE, [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com)'s new UI, and the pre-existing [React Mosaic](https://github.com/nomcopter/react-mosaic) project.

You can play around with Layman through [this demo](https://github.com/Jeshwin/react-layman).
