## About <a name = "about"></a>

This is an environment to test new features for my future frontend web design projects. Currently, I'm trying to implement a dynamic layout design similar to [Replit](https://replit.com)'s IDE and [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com)'s new UI

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

This project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) under the hood, so all you need to do is clone this repository and run `vite` or `npm run dev` in the main folder.

## Progress

- [ ] Dynamic Layout
    - [x] Rows and columns
    - [x] Adjustable windows
    - [ ] Drag and drop
    - [ ] Delete windows
    - [ ] Tabbed windows
